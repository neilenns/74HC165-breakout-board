# 74HC165 breakout board

This PCB provides access to the inputs of four serially connected 74HC165s. It's perfect for expanding the number
of inputs available on smaller Arduinos like the Pro Micro or Nano when building flight simulator components
that interact with [MobiFlight](http://www.mobiflight.com).

See the ORDERING.md file for information on how to order these boards from JLCPCB.
